# webmachine for Ruby [![travis](https://secure.travis-ci.org/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby.png)](http://travis-ci.org/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby)

webmachine-ruby is a port of
[Webmachine](https://github.com/basho/webmachine), which is written in
Erlang.  The goal of both projects is to expose interesting parts of
the HTTP protocol to your application in a declarative way.  This
means that you are less concerned with handling requests directly and
more with describing the behavior of the resources that make up your
application. Webmachine is not a web framework _per se_, but more of a
toolkit for building HTTP-friendly applications. For example, it does
not provide a templating engine or a persistence layer; those choices
are up to you.

## A Note about Rack

Webmachine has a Rack adapter -- thanks to Jamis Buck -- but when
using it, we recommend you ensure that NO middleware is used.  The
behaviors that are encapsulated in Webmachine could be broken by
middlewares that sit above it, and there is no way to detect them at
runtime. _Caveat implementor_. That said, Webmachine should behave properly
when given a clear stack.

## Getting Started

Webmachine is very young, but it's still easy to construct an
application for it!

```ruby
require 'webmachine'
# Require any of the files that contain your resources here
require 'my_resource' 
 
# Point all URIs at the MyResource class
Webmachine::Dispatcher.add_route(['*'], MyResource)
 
# Start the server, binds to port 8080 using WEBrick
Webmachine.run 
```

Your resource will look something like this:

```ruby
class MyResource < Webmachine::Resource
  def to_html
    "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
  end
end
```

Run the first file and your application is up. That's all there is to
it! If you want to customize your resource more, look at the available
callbacks in lib/webmachine/resource/callbacks.rb. For example, you
might want to enable "gzip" compression on your resource, for which
you can simply add an `encodings_provided` callback method:

```ruby
class MyResource < Webmachine::Resource
  def encodings_provided
    {"gzip" => :encode_gzip, "identity" => :encode_identity}
  end
  
  def to_html
    "<html><body>Hello, world!</body></html>"
  end
end
```

There are many other HTTP features exposed to your resource through
{Webmachine::Resource::Callbacks}. Give them a try!

### Configurator

There's a configurator that allows you to set the ip address and port
bindings as well as a different webserver adapter.  You can also add
your routes in a block. Both of these call return the `Webmachine`
module, so you could chain them if you like.

```ruby
require 'webmachine'
require 'my_resource'
 
Webmachine.routes do
  add ['*'], MyResource
end

Webmachine.configure do |config|
  config.ip = '127.0.0.1'
  config.port = 3000
  config.adapter = :Mongrel
end
 
# Start the server.
Webmachine.run
```

## Features

* Handles the hard parts of content negotiation, conditional
  requests, and response codes for you.
* Most callbacks can interrupt the decision flow by returning an
  integer response code. You generally only want to do this when new
  information comes to light, requiring a modification of the response.
* Supports WEBrick and Mongrel (1.2pre+), and a Rack shim. Other host
  servers are being investigated.
* Streaming/chunked response bodies are permitted as Enumerables,
  Procs, or Fibers!
* Unlike the Erlang original, it does real Language negotiation.

## Problems/TODOs

* Command-line tools, and general polish.
* Tracing is exposed as an Array of decisions visited on the response
  object. You should be able to turn this off and on, and visualize
  the decisions on the sequence diagram.

## Changelog

### 0.3.0 November 9, 2011

0.3.0 introduces some new features, refactorings, and now has 100%
documentation coverage! Among the new features are minimal Rack
compatibility, streaming responses via Fibers and a friendlier route
definition syntax. Added Jamis Buck as a committer. Thank you for your
contributions!

* Chunked bodies are now wrapped in a way that works on webservers
  that don't automatically produce them.
* HTTP Basic Authentication is easy to add to resources, just include
  `Webmachine::Resource::Authentication`.
* Routes are a little less painful to add, you can now specify them
  with `Webmachine.routes` which will be evaled into the `Dispatcher`.
* The new default port is 8080.
* Rack is minimally supported as a host server. _Don't put middleware
  above Webmachine!_
* Fibers can be used as streamed response bodies.
* `Dispatcher#add_route` will now return the added `Route` instance.
* The header-conversion code for CGI-style servers has been extracted
  into `Webmachine::Headers`.
* `Route#path_spec` is now public so that applications can inspect
  existing routes, perhaps for URL generation.
* `Request#query` now uses `CGI.unescape` so '+' characters are
  correctly parsed.
* YARD documentation has 100% coverage.

### 0.2.0 September 11, 2011

0.2.0 includes an adapter for Mongrel and a central place for
configuration as well as numerous bugfixes. Added Ian Plosker and
Bernd Ahlers as committers. Thank you for your contributions!

* Acceptable media types are matched less strictly, which has
  implications on both responses and PUT requests. See the
  [discussion on the commit](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby/commit/3686d0d9ff77fc98aff59f89478e9c6c18844ca1).
* Resources now receive a callback after the language has been
  negotiated, so they can decide what to do with it.
* Added `Webmachine::Configuration` so we can more easily support more
  than one host server/adapter.
* Added Mongrel adapter, supporting 1.2pre+.
* Media type headers are more lax about whitespace following
  semicolons.
* Fix some problems with callable response bodies.
* Make sure String response bodies get a Content-Length header added
  and streaming responses get chunked encoding.
* Numerous refactorings, including extracting `MediaType` into its own
  top-level class.

### 0.1.0 August 25, 2011

This is the initial release. Most things work, but only WEBrick is supported.
